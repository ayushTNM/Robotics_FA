# RoboHiders Final Assignment

This robotics final project focuses on creating a ”Hide and Seek” robot that uses facial detection and environmental awareness (distance sensor). The robot will be able to detect faces to see if someone is looking at it. It will also find a hiding spot by traversing the environment and identifying places where it can hide.

## Prerequisites

### Installation/Library

- PiCar-4WD library
- OpenCV
- PiCamera2 library
- NumPy

### Hardware

- PiCar-4WD robot kit

## Usage

### Hardware setup
- Run `python ultrasonicAngleCalibration.py` to calibrate the distance sensor facing forward
- Adjust camera to face directly forward / very slightly upward

### Running code
- Run `python basic-hiding.py`
